### Steps for Integration

1. Open the base directory of your Vue.js application in your IDE.
   ![enter image description here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a741dae8-d47f-4837-9cd2-9e1919b603a1)

2. First install `posthog-js`

   ```ssh
   npm install posthog-js
   ```

3. Now, we need to install a plugin by creating a new folder in your base directory called `plugins` and then a new file `posthog.js`:

   ```ssh
   mkdir plugins
   cd plugins
   touch posthog.js
   ```

   Add the following code to your `posthog.js` file:

   ```ssh
   import posthog from "posthog-js";

   export default {
     install(app) {
       app.config.globalProperties.$posthog = posthog.init(
         "<ph_project_api_key>",
         {
           api_host: "https://us.i.posthog.com",
           person_profiles: 'identified_only',
         }
       );
     },
   };
   ```

   Replace `<ph_project_api_key>` with your your PostHog API key. You can find these in your [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project).
   ![enter image description here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d211181a-130f-4dab-bdd9-1f1c951c51af)
   You will find your API Key in the **Web Snippet** section.

4. Finally, activate your plugin in `main.js`:

   ```ssh
    import { createApp } from 'vue'
   import App from './App.vue'
   import posthogPlugin from '../plugins/posthog';

   createApp(App)
   .use(posthogPlugin)
   .mount('#app');
   ```

5. Once youâ€™ve done this, reload your app and click the buttons a few times. You should see events appearing in the [PostHog events explorer](https://app.posthog.com/events).![enter image description here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59a7aa46-6bd3-48bf-9f43-52b7f4314b0f)

### NOTE

In case the interactions are not reflected in the [events explorer page](https://app.posthog.com/events), follow the following steps:

1. Open Chrome or Firefox, and search `Privacy Badger Extension`.

   ![enter image description here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74cd3e0b-3c05-4d52-8c85-ee678ad4a181)

3. Now open the Vue app in the browser and click on a couple of buttons. Then click on the extensions button and find the Privacy Badger extension there.

   Enable the trackers associated with posthog.

Now the interactions of your applications will be visible.
