# Learning outcomes

After finishing this tutorial the student will be able to

## Level 1: Remembering and Understanding

- Define **web analytics** and **observability**, and explain their key concepts.
- Differentiate between web analytics and observability.
- Identify tools commonly used for web analytics and observability.
- Describe the importance of metrics, logs, and traces in observability and their role in system health monitoring.

## Level 2: Applying

- Implement web analytics by configuring tools like **Posthog** to track specific website performance metrics.
- Set up observability tools such as **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor and visualize system health.
- Configure **OpenTelemetry** to collect and analyze trace, metric, and log data from a sample web application.
- Create custom dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to both analytics and observability.

# Overview &amp; History

## Web Analytics

### Definition

Web analytics includes the analysis of the behavior of visitors to a website through the tracking, review, and reporting of data generated by their use of the site and its various components, including webpages, images, and videos. This is to be used for actionable insights that will drive actions to enable the site owner to enhance the usability of the website for users and, ultimately, achieve business objectives of increased traffic, conversions, or sales.
